# Play Music from microSD Card

- [中文版](./README_CN.md)

## Example Brief

This example demonstrates how to use `esp_board_manager` to initialize the codec and sdcard, obtain device handles, and play music from a microSD card using the `esp_codec_dev` API.

## Example Set Up

### IDF Default Branch

This example supports IDF release/v5.5 (>=5.5.2) and IDF release/v5.4 (>=5.4.3) branches.

### Preparation

This example requires a microSD card with a WAV file named `test.wav` in the root directory.

### Build and Flash

Before compiling this example, ensure that the ESP-IDF environment is properly set up. If not, run the following script in the root directory of ESP-IDF to set up the build environment. For detailed steps on configuring and using ESP-IDF, please refer to the [ESP-IDF Programming Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/index.html):

```shell
./install.sh
. ./export.sh
```

Here are the summarized compilation steps:

- Navigate to the test project directory for playing music from a microSD card:

```shell
cd $YOUR_GMF_PATH/packages/esp_board_manager/example/dev_audio_codec/play_sdcard_music
```

- Configure the `esp_board_manager` path to activate the environment (only needs to be executed once under the current terminal):

```shell
# Ubuntu and Mac:
export IDF_EXTRA_ACTIONS_PATH=$YOUR_GMF_PATH/packages/esp_board_manager

# Windows PowerShell:
$env:IDF_EXTRA_ACTIONS_PATH = "$YOUR_GMF_PATH/packages/esp_board_manager"

# Windows Command Prompt (CMD):
set IDF_EXTRA_ACTIONS_PATH=$YOUR_GMF_PATH/packages/esp_board_manager
```

- Select the development board to use:

```shell
idf.py gen-bmgr-config -b esp32_s3_korvo2_v3
```

- You can also run the following command to see a list of supported development boards:

```shell
idf.py gen-bmgr-config -l
```

- Compile the example code:

```shell
idf.py build
```

- Flash the program and run the monitor tool to view serial output (replace PORT with your port name):

```shell
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

- To exit the debugging interface, use `Ctrl-]`.

## How to Use the Example

### Functionality and Usage

- After the example starts, it will automatically play the `test.wav` file from the microSD card. The output will be as follows:

## Troubleshooting

1. If you encounter the following error message, please run `echo $IDF_EXTRA_ACTIONS_PATH` to check if the `esp_board_manager` path is configured correctly:

```c
Usage: idf.py gen-bmgr-config [OPTIONS]
Try 'idf.py gen-bmgr-config --help' for help.

Error: No such option: -b
```

2. If you need to use a custom development board, please refer to the instructions on **custom boards** in [README.md](../../../README.md).
